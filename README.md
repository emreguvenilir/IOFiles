# Homework 2

## PLEASE I AM BEGGING YOU
include cstdlib in your code when using random numbers.

### Some helpful tips:
1) 2 space indents for your indentation scheme.
2) Use constants for numbers that are important and won't change.
   e.g. my_int % 2 for testing if a number is even is not important (don't need a const for 2)
        If Homer's IQ was assigned in the HW and represents something, so it's important (should have been a const)
3) Validate your user inputs!

### Some Grading Info:
Note, these are just some general ones, these are not the only things you can lose points for
1) -1 for every literal you have that should be a constant (max -15)
2) -5 for not using 2 space indents
3) -10 for incorrect output values
4) -5 for bad output (non-descriptive, sloppy, etc.) formatting
5) -30 for non-compiling code
6) -10 for warnings in the output
7) -5 for any function we specifically request in the instructions but you don't have in your code
8) -5 for each function missing the university standard documentation (max -15)
9) -10 for not using multiple files

### Grading Info Specific To This Assignment:
1) -3 for seeding more than once

### Remember:
Throughout the semester you can ask your instructor or myself (Richie) for help in the class and with the work. We are available via email (Richie: rerc7r@mst.edu) or on the 1570 Discord (@Richie#0508). DMing me in discord will likely get you the fastest reply.

### Git Help

Some of you may not be familiar with git still, so here are the basic steps:

* Clone the repo using the "clone/download" and copy the link in the HTTPS box.
* Create a cs1570 folder in your SDRIVE if you don't have one already: mkdir cs1570 and cd cs1570 so you're inside the folder.
* git clone the-link-you-copied
* This should create a folder called 2020-SP-CS1570-hwX. You can now cd into that folder.
* Whenever you create a new file git will track your changes and you can add your file to the repo by doing git add filename.ext
* Now we can "commit" our file! You need to add a message with your commit to briefly explain what your changes are. git commit -m "I made a file with my name in it!". The message will show up in your git repo, so be careful of what you write.
* Finally you can "push" your changes to the git repo! git push  is all you need to do, it'll ask you to login with your info so once you login you'll be done.
